### Scrimba Interview Coding Challenges 

Here, I try to practice some coding challenges daily and document how I approached solving them. All code my version. 

ðŸŒ¼ 01 - [Panic Function](https://github.com/ivavay/scrimba-interview-challenges/tree/main/01_panic-function)

I first tried using a for and a while loop to see if it'd work if I loop through each character of the string to see if there is a blank space. Then, I found out that there is the ```replaceAll()``` method which can do that instead. The final solution takes a string in lowercase, converts all letters to uppercase, and finds all empty spaces and replaces them with an emoji. 

ðŸŒ¼ 02 - [Whisper Function](https://github.com/ivavay/scrimba-interview-challenges/tree/main/02_whisper-function) 

This exercise surprisingly only took 4-5 minutes to complete because it is very similar to the previous one. I appended a string to the front of the sentence using concatenation, converted all letters to lowercase, and used the ```replace``` method to remove the ending exclamation mark.

ðŸŒ¼ 03 - [Alternating Caps](https://github.com/ivavay/scrimba-interview-challenges/tree/main/02_whisper-function)

I got to work for the most part except I couldn't figure out how the output string has ```undefined``` attached to it in the front. The goal was to take a string and convert each letter into alternating lowercase and uppercase. I used an if/else inside a while loop for this.
