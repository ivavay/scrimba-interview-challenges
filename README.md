### Scrimba Interview Coding Challenges 

Here, I try to practice some coding challenges daily and document how I approached solving them. 

ðŸŒ¼ 01 â€” [Panic Function](https://github.com/ivavay/scrimba-interview-challenges/tree/main/01_panic-function)

I first tried using a for and a while loop to see if it'd work if I loop through each character of the string to see if there is a blank space. Then, I found out that there is the ```replaceAll()``` method which can do that instead. The final solution takes a string in lowercase, converts all letters to uppercase, and finds all empty spaces and replaces them with an emoji.
